# BUG_REPORT_cursor.md

## Branch & Working State

- **Branch:** `feature/elixact-atom-type-support`
- **Uncommitted changes:**
  - Modified: `.gitignore`, `lib/elixact/types.ex`, `lib/elixact/validator.ex`, `lib/elixact/json_schema/type_mapper.ex`
  - Untracked: `test/elixact/types/atom_test.exs`, `test/elixact/types/optional_nil_test.exs`, `test/elixact/types/tuple_union_test.exs`

## Final Status (2024-06-09)

- **All tests pass:** All core, edge-case, and integration tests now pass, including atom, tuple, union, nil, and custom type edge cases.
- **Dialyzer clean:** All dialyzer warnings and errors have been resolved, including unreachable pattern matches and type spec issues in `type_mapper.ex`.
- **Literal atom handling:** Tuple and union validation now correctly treats literal atoms (e.g., `:system`) as values, not schema references, and only schema modules are wrapped as `{:ref, atom}`.
- **Normalization logic:** Type normalization is robust and only schema modules are wrapped as references; all other atoms are treated as literals or custom types as appropriate.
- **Unreachable pattern removal:** All unreachable or redundant pattern matches and guards have been removed from the codebase, especially in validator and type_mapper modules.

## Summary of Resolved Issues

- **Atom type support:** Fully implemented and tested, including choices constraints.
- **Nil handling:** Optional fields with nil are correctly rejected unless explicitly allowed.
- **Tuple/Union support:** All tuple and union validation logic is correct, including nested and constrained types.
- **Custom types:** Custom type validation and error handling is robust, including invalid type definitions.
- **JSON Schema generation:** All schema references and custom types are handled correctly, with no unreachable code or dialyzer errors.
- **Integration:** All integration and edge-case tests pass, including those required for DSPEx.

## Previously Listed Failures (all resolved)

- Atom choices constraint
- Type normalization edge cases
- Union with constraints
- Deeply nested validation
- Nested unions
- Custom type with complex constraints
- Union constraint combinations
- Union validation order
- Validation path tracking
- Deeply nested union types
- Schema references in complex types
- Complex nested field types
- JSON Schema generation
- Integration with external systems

## Next Steps

- **Codebase is clean and robust.** No further action required unless new features or edge cases are identified.
- **If new requirements arise,** update tests and bug report accordingly.
