- All core limitations resolved (atom, union, tuple, nil handling, custom error messages, custom validation functions)
- Elixact fully supports all required DSPEx features and advanced validation needs
- 293/293 tests passing with clean dialyzer output

## 6. **✅ COMPLETED: Object Map Validation Enhancement (2024-06-14)**

**Previous Limitation:** Only homogeneous key/value maps supported, not fixed-key object/struct validation

**✅ Successfully Implemented:** Added support for object-style maps with predefined field schemas:
```elixir
# Previous: homogeneous maps only
Types.map(Types.string(), Types.integer())  # %{any_string => integer}

# ✅ Now Available: fixed-key object validation
Types.object(%{
  name: Types.string(),
  age: Types.integer(),
  active: Types.boolean()
})  # %{name: string, age: integer, active: boolean}
```

**✅ Implementation Complete:**
- Added `Types.object/1` function with field schema map
- Added `{:object, fields_map, constraints}` type definition to typespec
- Updated `Types.normalize_type/1` to handle object definitions
- Added `validate_object/4` function in Validator with proper field validation
- Created comprehensive test suite with 19 test cases covering:
  - Basic object validation
  - Nested objects
  - Objects with arrays and unions
  - Constraint validation
  - Error handling with proper path tracking
  - Edge cases and normalization

**✅ Quality Assurance:**
- All 251 tests passing (including 19 new object tests)
- Zero dialyzer warnings
- Full backward compatibility maintained

**Impact:** ✅ Enables validation of complex nested configuration objects in DSPEx

---

**Next Steps:**  
1. ✅ **Core foundation complete** - All atom/union/tuple features working
2. ✅ **Object map validation complete** - Fixed-key map schemas implemented
3. ✅ **Custom error messages complete** - Per-field custom validation messages
4. ✅ **Custom validation functions complete** - User-defined business logic validation
5. 🎯 **Advanced features available** - Ready for wildcard paths, cross-field validation, conditional validation

## 7. **✅ COMPLETED: Custom Error Messages Enhancement (2024-06-14)**

**Previous Limitation:** Only generic error messages were provided

**✅ Successfully Implemented:** Added support for per-field custom error messages:
```elixir
# Previous: generic error messages only
Types.string() |> Types.with_constraints(min_length: 3)
# Error: "failed min_length constraint"

# ✅ Now Available: custom error messages
Types.string() 
|> Types.with_constraints(min_length: 3)
|> Types.with_error_message(:min_length, "Name must be at least 3 characters long")
# Error: "Name must be at least 3 characters long"

# ✅ Also Available: multiple custom error messages
Types.string()
|> Types.with_constraints([min_length: 3, max_length: 50])
|> Types.with_error_messages([
  min_length: "Name must be at least 3 characters long",
  max_length: "Name cannot exceed 50 characters"
])
```

**✅ Implementation Complete:**
- Added `Types.with_error_message/3` function for single constraint custom messages
- Added `Types.with_error_messages/2` function for multiple constraint custom messages
- Extended constraint system to include `{:error_message, constraint, message}` tuples
- Updated `Validator.apply_constraints/3` to use custom messages when available
- Added comprehensive test suite with 22 test cases covering:
  - Basic custom error message functionality
  - Multiple constraint custom messages
  - All constraint types (min_length, max_length, gt, lt, choices, format, etc.)
  - Edge cases and fallback behavior
  - Integration with existing validation system

**✅ Quality Assurance:**
- All 273 tests passing (including 22 new custom error message tests)
- Zero dialyzer warnings and zero compilation warnings
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Graceful fallback to default error messages when custom messages not provided

**Impact:** ✅ Provides significantly improved user experience with descriptive, contextual validation errors

---

## 8. **✅ COMPLETED: Custom Validation Functions Enhancement (2024-06-14)**

**Previous Limitation:** No support for user-defined business logic validation

**✅ Successfully Implemented:** Added support for custom validation functions:
```elixir
# Previous: only basic constraint validation available
Types.string()
|> Types.with_constraints([min_length: 3])
# Limited to built-in constraints only

# ✅ Now Available: custom validation functions
Types.string()
|> Types.with_constraints([min_length: 3])
|> Types.with_validator(fn value ->
  if String.contains?(value, "@"), do: {:ok, value}, else: {:error, "Must contain @"}
end)

# ✅ Advanced Example: complex business logic validation
Types.string()
|> Types.with_validator(fn value ->
  cond do
    not String.contains?(value, "@") -> {:error, "Must be a valid email address"}
    not String.match?(value, ~r/^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/) -> {:error, "Email format is invalid"}
    String.length(value) > 100 -> {:error, "Email address too long"}
    true -> {:ok, String.downcase(value)}  # Can transform value
  end
end)
```

**✅ Implementation Complete:**
- Added `Types.with_validator/2` function for custom validation logic
- Extended constraint system to include `{:validator, validator_fn}` tuples
- Updated `Validator.apply_constraints/3` to execute custom validators when available
- Custom validators execute after regular constraints pass
- Support for value transformation in custom validators
- Graceful error handling for invalid validator return formats
- Created comprehensive test suite with 20 test cases covering:
  - Basic custom validator functionality
  - Complex multi-condition validators
  - Value transformation capabilities
  - Integration with existing constraint system
  - Multiple validator chaining
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Exception handling from validators

**✅ Quality Assurance:**
- All 293 tests passing (including 20 new custom validation function tests)
- Zero dialyzer warnings and zero compilation warnings
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Proper error reporting with descriptive messages
- Exception handling preserves stack traces

**Impact:** ✅ Enables complex business logic validation beyond basic constraints, supporting email validation, custom formatting, data transformation, and sophisticated validation rules

**Validation Features Available:**
- **Custom Logic:** Any validation logic expressible in Elixir functions
- **Value Transformation:** Validators can modify values (e.g., normalization, formatting)
- **Error Messages:** Custom error messages for specific business rule violations
- **Execution Order:** Custom validators run after built-in constraints pass
- **Multiple Validators:** Chain multiple custom validators for complex validation
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with existing constraint and error message systems

## 9. **Next Enhancement Target: Advanced Features**

All core validation features are now complete. Future enhancement priorities:

1. **Wildcard Path Support** - Dynamic/wildcard schema matching for flexible configurations
2. **Cross-field Validation** - Validation rules that depend on multiple fields
3. **Conditional Validation** - Validation rules that apply conditionally based on other field values
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Caching and optimization for large schema validations
